Description
===========

This program allows you to copy text and open URLs from one computer to another. 

All you do is select text and hit one hotkey to copy it to the clipboard of the other computer, or hit a different hotkey to open the selected URL on the other computer.

Right now I am releasing a "mini" version made in python. I initially wanted to make a full fledge C++ program, but this will have to do for now.
